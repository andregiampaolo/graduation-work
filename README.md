Modeling topics as a proposal for classifying the organizational recruitment curriculum database.pdf
(A modelagem de tópicos como proposta para classificação de banco de currículos de recrutamento organizacional)

This repo contains the code of my graduation work that I presented in September 11, 2018.

It's splited in two project:
1. `web-crawler-resume` was used to get all the data (resumes from [Banco Nacional de Empregos - BNE](https://www.bne.com.br/)) used
2. `lda` contains the result of my graduation work.

The validation doesn't contain any data beacause it is deleted at each execution of the project.
If you want to see the results open the article and see the section `Resultados`

You can access the project in https://lda-resumes.herokuapp.com/report/report
